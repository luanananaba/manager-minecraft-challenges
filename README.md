# Minecraft Server Challenges

This project is designed to manage various challenges on my Minecraft server with mods. It allows players to participate in different custom challenges, track their progress, and compete with others. It's a fun way to enhance gameplay and keep the community engaged with new and exciting tasks.

## This is a project made to deepen my knowledge of Python and also help me manage ideas that I have only in a simple Minecraft world, making the program a bit more complex.

### Ideas:

- ✅ Players tab;

- ✅ Admin Login tab: Login required to access this part of the program;

- ✅ On login, Admin Login tab disappears and Admins tab appears;

- ❎ Players tab: Access the Player’s Nickname, choose the mod to show which achievements have not yet been completed by the player and a button to list all achievements made by the player;

- ✅ Admins tab: Add Player’s Nickname + mod + challenge + challenge points to the player, all containing buttons;

- ❎ Player Ranking in the Players tab: how many points they have and how many achievements have been completed (points being the most decisive part for climbing the rank).
